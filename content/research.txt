The concept of active networks is not new. Decades ago, there was a vision within the networking community that programs can be encoded within packets and run on devices within the forwarding path. The Active Node Transfer System (ANTS) was one of the more popular variants. However, the vision faded away with time (at least in part) due to a perceived lack of utility within the community as well as the unavailability of hardware well-suited to this task. That said, functionality continued to be implemented in the network till date using devices such as network processors. The cost of such devices is of course significantly higher than traditional packet forwarding devices such as switches and routers. The difference in cost is justified by the rich functionality offered through such means. Recent trends have however shifted towards programmable switching hardware revolutionized by Barefoot Networkâ€™s line of Tofino switches. These devices are currently capable of delivering around 12.8 Terabits/sec of throughput while being able to execute non-trivial functionality within the switch. Tofino switches and their associated toolchain have fueled the development of numerous in-network applications over the past few years. This observation has led us to believe that we can once again consider the utility of active networks in the context of programmable switches. Our goal in this project is to enable this multi-decade old vision to become a consumable reality.
