<p>I am Batman! No wait, I am, ummm, a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India
Labs. Did that make any sense to you? Well it's a place where wannabe researchers
(like me) get trained by real researchers to take a leap of faith into PhD. You 
see, PhD is not a piece of cake (at least that is what we were told) and the (real)
researchers here are devoted to discourage us from pursuing one. I am one of those 
stupid RFs who is dedicated to make that long established mistake of pursuing a 
PhD in spite of all warnings, and we are the ones who get adored here. Trust me, 
it is a great place to be and the people are awesome! </p>  

<p>So let me show you around :). I am actually a certified engineer in Computer 
Sciences and Engineering, and
no, I don't repair computers. My CV will reflect these boring aspects of my life.
My Projects/Hobbies may throw some light on the sort of things that have interested
me so far, in the different phases of my career. I have also done things off the
beaten track, to satisfy my other interests which didn't align with any of my
career phases. In case you wanted to stalk my social profiles ( just kidding ;) ), 
I have them listed to the left.
Nevertheless this web site will not reveal as much to you about myself as I 
personally could. Hence that email address below my name might be helpful, in
case you are interested. </p>
