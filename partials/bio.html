<p>I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego (UCSD). I have recently joined the sysnet lab at UCSD where I am working with my wonderful advisors - Alex Snoeren and George Porter - on datacenter fault detection. Prior to coming here I was at Microsoft Research India, working as a Research Fellow in the Mobility, Networks and Systems group. </p>

<p>I love networked systems and enjoy building and hacking stuff. I am also a cycling enthusiast and have recently started mountain biking. I do love other outdoor activities such as hiking, and also board games (thanks to some of my friends). So if you're around and into these as well, do ping me!</p>
