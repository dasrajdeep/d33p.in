<p>This is Rajdeep. I live in La Jolla, California, where I am currently a PhD student at UC San Diego. I have recently joined the sysnet lab at UCSD where I am working with my wonderful advisors - Alex Snoeren and George Porter - on datacenter fault detection. Prior to coming here, I was at Microsoft Research India, working as a Research Fellow in the Mobility, Networks and Systems group. I love networked systems and enjoy building and hacking stuff. I am also a cycling enthusiast and have recently started mountain biking. I do love other outdoor activities such as trekking and hiking, and also board games (thanks to some of my friends). So if you're around and into these as well, do ping me! </p>

<!--<p>So let me show you around :). If you are interested in my qualifications and achievements, then you should look at my CV which is right next door. Just beside it are two major things that I have worked on so far. Those familiar social icons to the left are ways to connect with me, but honestly, Facebook and Skype are the places where you would actually want to catch me. I don't know why Google+ still exists, but for the sake of completeness (and since it makes this page look nice) I have put it there. Out of sheer compulsion I created my LinkedIn account, so don't expect to find much there. You can check my last Twitter post to figure out how active I am on it. Finally, if none of these suit you, that email address below my name might be helpful. </p>

<p>I am Batman! No wait, I am, ummm, a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India
Labs. Did that make any sense to you? Well it's a place where wannabe researchers
(like me) get trained by real researchers to take a leap of faith into PhD. You 
see, PhD is not a piece of cake (at least that is what we were told) and the (real)
researchers here are devoted to discourage us from pursuing one. I am one of those 
stupid RFs who is dedicated to make that long established mistake of pursuing a 
PhD in spite of all warnings, and we are the ones who get adored here. Trust me, 
it is a great place to be and the people are awesome! </p>  -->
